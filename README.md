 Slide toggle with rolling ball

 This was my first real attempt at drawing anything using CSS so I kept things nice and simple. The various parts of the slide toggle were layered on top of each other and I gave the ball 4 sections so that you could see the rolling animation.

 I used keyframes to move the and rotate the ball back and forth and set the speed curve to ease-in-out over the course of 1s to give it a nice smooth motion. Setting animation-direction to alternate stops the toggle from resetting after each animation.
